# MathLibrary
Refactored and added functionality to an existing library of math functions. Function files I did not write (everything other than the main MathOperations.c and Armstrong files, the latter of which were pair-programmed with Wali Temuri) are not included.

# Purpose & Functionality
The purpose of this program is to allow the user to compute different mathematical operations.
The following math operations are accessible through the menu:
- MathOperations: Main 
- BaseConversion: Convert number from a base to any base (not included)
- GreatestCommonDivisor: Computes greates common divisor (not included)
- Fibonacci: Gets nth term of Fibonacci sequence (not included)
- PrimalityTest: Checks if number is prime (not included)
- PrimeFactorization: Computes prime factorization (not included)

Added functions:
- Armstrong: Determines if number is an armstrong number
- Factorial: Determines factorial of a number

# Running
Terminal commands:
- make -> compiles program code
- make clean -> removes output files
- ./A2 -> runs program

# Other Contributors
Co-wrote the main .c and .h files and the makefile.
